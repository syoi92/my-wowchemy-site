abstract: "The non-spatial information of cadastral maps must be repeatedly updated to monitor recent changes in land property and to detect illegal land registrations by tax evaders. Since non-spatial information, such as land category, is usually updated by field-based surveys, it is time-consuming and only a limited area can be updated at a time. Although land categories can be updated by remote sensing techniques, the update is typically performed through manual analysis, namely through a visually interpreted comparison between the newly generated land information and the existing cadastral maps. A cost-effective, fast alternative to the current surveying methods would improve the efficiency of land management. For this purpose, the present study analyzes the discrepancy between the existing cadastral map and the actual land use. Our proposed method operates in two steps. First, an up-to-date land cover map is generated from hyperspectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. These images are effectively classified by a hybrid two- and three-dimensional convolutional neural network. Second, a discrepancy map, which contains the ratio of the area that is being used differently from the registered land use in each parcel, is constructed through a three-stage inconsistency comparison. As a case study, the proposed method was evaluated using hyperspectral UAV images acquired at two sites of Jeonju in South Korea. The overall classification accuracies of six land classes at Sites 1 and 2 were 99.93% and 99.75% and those at Sites 1 and 2 are 39.4% and 34.4%, respectively, which had discrepancy ratios of 50% or higher. Finally, discrepancy maps between the land cover maps and existing cadastral maps were generated and visualized. The method automatically reveals the inconsistent parcels requiring updates of their land category. Although the performance of the proposed method depends on the classification results obtained from UAV imagery, the method allows a flexible modification of the matching criteria between the land categories and land coverage. Therefore, it is generalizable to various cadastral systems and the discrepancy ratios will provide practical information and significantly reduce the time and effort for land monitoring and field surveying."
