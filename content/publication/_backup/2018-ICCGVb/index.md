abstract: "There has been a recent increasing interest in guaranteeing the right for mobility of the transportation vulnerable and the demand for indoor routing services has been increasing as well. This paper proposes an indoor pedestrian network data model for navigation services for the transportation vulnerable. Based on the proposed network data model, it will be possible to design and construct indoor and outdoor network data in the future. In the proposed model, indoor ambulation facilities have been included and properties of the connecting facilities have been defined in detail, compared to the previous models."
