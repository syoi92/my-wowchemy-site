I am currently a research fellow at Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering ([ICEE](https://cee.snu.ac.kr/english/index.php)). I finished my MEng in SPatial INformatics Group at Seoul National University, advised by [Yongil Kim](http://spins.snu.ac.kr/) and [Kiyun Yu](https://gislbs.net/). I got my BE in architectural engineering at Seoul National Univeristy in South Korea. 

As an early startup team member, I am also participating in [UITI](http://uiti.co.kr/) [[ :email:]](mailto:ceo@uiti.com) based on LBS business in Korea. I engaged in launching [집현전 [Wise Strategy to Buy a House]](https://ziphz.com/), the web service that recommends real estate to customers and links them to agents with low broker fees. Besides, by proposing a business item recommending starting locations to new business owners, I won a government fund worth $50000 in my sole name. For doing that, I've been working on a Minimum Value Product with the team I've hired.

I plan to be an incoming student for the doctoral program in CEE at [Georgia Tech](https://ce.gatech.edu/) from 2021 Spring.
